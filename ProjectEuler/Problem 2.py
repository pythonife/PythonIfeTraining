## Two functions
## function 1 is fibonacci: This function finds the whole list of numbers with values less than n.
## sumEvenValue: This is function 2, this finds the sum of all numbers in the list that is divisible by 2.
 
def fibonacci(n):
    c = 2
    SequenceList = [1,2] #initialize your list with 2 starting numbers 1&2
    while c < n: # loop from 0 until c is greater than n
        c = SequenceList[-1] + SequenceList[-2] #sum the last 2 numbers in the list.
        SequenceList.append(c) #append the sum of the last 2 numbers.

    return SequenceList[:-1] #return all in the list except the number greater than n
 
def SumEvenValue(n):
    Total = 0
    sequence = fibonacci(n) #call the function fibonacci and pass in n.
    for i in sequence: #loop through the fibonacci sequence
        if i%2 == 0: #test if current value is divisible by 2
            Total += i #if so add the number to total.
 
    return Total #return the total number when program is done

x = SumEvenValue(4000000) #call the program to run
print(x) #print your answer
